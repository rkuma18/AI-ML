    "# TF-IDF: A Friendly Guide to Understanding Text Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is TF-IDF?\n",
    "Imagine you're trying to understand how important words are in a collection of documents. TF-IDF is like a special detective that helps you figure out which words are truly meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Two-Step Magic: TF and IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Term Frequency (TF) - How Often Words Appear\n",
    "Think of Term Frequency like counting how many times a word shows up in a single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- Document: \"The cat sat on the mat. The cat is fluffy.\"\n",
    "- Word counts:\n",
    "  - \"the\": 2 times\n",
    "  - \"cat\": 2 times\n",
    "  - \"sat\": 1 time\n",
    "  - \"on\": 1 time\n",
    "  - \"mat\": 1 time\n",
    "  - \"is\": 1 time\n",
    "  - \"fluffy\": 1 time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) - How Unique a Word Is\n",
    "IDF helps us understand how special or rare a word is across ALL documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have three documents:\n",
    "1. \"The cat is fluffy\"\n",
    "2. \"The dog is playful\"\n",
    "3. \"The bird flies high\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"the\" appears in ALL documents (common word)\n",
    "- \"cat\" appears in only ONE document (more unique)\n",
    "- \"fluffy\" appears in only ONE document (very unique)\n",
    "\n",
    "IDF gives more weight to unique words and less weight to common words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting TF and IDF Together\n",
    "\n",
    "The TF-IDF score is calculated by multiplying Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "TF-IDF = (Number of times word appears in a document) \n",
    "         ร (Log of total documents รท Number of documents with the word)\n",
    "```"
