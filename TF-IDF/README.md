# 📊 TF-IDF: Text Analysis Powerhouse

This repository provides a comprehensive, from-scratch implementation of the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm, 
offering a deep dive into text analysis and natural language processing techniques.



## 🎯 Purpose

TF-IDF is a crucial technique in natural language processing that helps:
- Identify important words in documents
- Improve search engine rankings
- Enhance text classification
- Support recommendation systems

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Pure Python implementation
- 📈 Flexible document processing
- 🧠 Detailed explanations of each step
- 🚀 Easy to integrate and extend

## 🛠 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy (optional, but recommended)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tfidf-project.git
cd tfidf-project
```

## 📘 How It Works

### Term Frequency (TF)
Measures how frequently a term appears in a document:
- Counts word occurrences
- Normalizes by document length

### Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
Calculates the rarity of a word across documents:
- Logarithmically scales word uniqueness
- Reduces impact of common words

### TF-IDF Calculation
Combines TF and IDF to determine word importance:
```
TF-IDF = TF * IDF
       = (term frequency) * log(total documents / documents with term)
```

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

- Time Complexity: O(N * M), where N is number of documents, M is number of unique words
- Memory Efficiency: Optimized for medium-sized document collections
- Scalability: Suitable for most text analysis tasks
